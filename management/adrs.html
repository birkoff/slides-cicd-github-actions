				<section>
					<p>An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that represent decisions made by the team and provide a history of all changes the team makes that affects the structure, quality attributes, or behavior of a system.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>These <b>DECISIONS</b> are driven by both functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="framework-goals">
					<h2>Framework Goals</h2>
					<p>The ADR framework establishes a culture of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Visibility:</strong>
							Decisions are not hidden in private chats or emails.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Traceability:</strong>
							The "why" behind a design is preserved for future developers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong>
							Ensures teams, programs, and departments move in the same direction.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h4>Implementation and Enforcement</h4>
					<img src="assets/adr.png" class="r-stretch">
					<p>The team uses the ADRs as a reference during code and architectural reviews, design and implementation tasks.</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>ADR Contents</h2>
					<p>ADRs should follow a project-wide template to ensure consistency. At a minimum, every record must include:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Context:</strong>
							What is the problem? What are the pressures or constraints?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Decision:</strong>
							What is the proposed solution?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Consequences:</strong>
							What are the trade-offs? What becomes easier or harder as a result?
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="zoom">
					<h3>The Review Workflow</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Proposed:</strong> The ADR is written and shared for review.</li>
						<li><strong>Review Meeting:</strong> The team spends 10–15 minutes reading the ADR and flagging unclear topics.</li>
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> The owner discusses comments with the team.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Outcome: </strong>Accepted / Rejected / Rework
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
